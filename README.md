# RXQ v1.0 - Build RESTful web applications with XQuery RESTXQ Annotations

The release of [MarkLogic 6](http://www.marklogic.com) includes support for many cool [XQuery 3.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-30) features. 
One such feature, [annotations](http://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-30/#id-annotations), provides an opportunity to implement Adam Retter's [RESTXQ](http://exquery.github.com/exquery/exquery-restxq-specification/restxq-1.0-specification.html#method-annotation) draft (introduced at [XML Prague 2012](http://archive.xmlprague.cz/2012/sessions.html#RESTful-XQuery---Standardised-XQuery-3.0-Annotations-for-REST)).

RESTXQ proposes an elegant approach for building RESTFul interfaces, in addition to full blown web applications using XQuery within a consistent MVC architecture.

RESTXQ is based on the annotations defined within [JSR-311](http://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/jaxrs-1.0-fr-eval-oth-JSpec).

To understand what RESTXQ is and how it works with XQuery 3.0 annotations please [download](http://archive.xmlprague.cz/2012/presentations/RESTful_XQuery.pdf) Adam Retter's excellent overview.

# For the Impatient (set up example application)

MarkLogic 6.0-3 is reccomended version for use with RXQ.

The quickest way to see RXQ in action is to setup the example application under [src/example-site](https://github.com/xquery/rxq/tree/master/src/example-site).

First, you *need* to download and install [MarkLogic 6](https://developer.marklogic.com/products). Second, create an appserver, providing the following details;

* _root_: provide directory where example-site resides on your filesystem
* _error handler_: `/rxq-rewriter.xqy?mode=error`
* _rewrite handler_: `/rxq-rewriter.xqy?mode=rewrite`

With everything setup, you can now point your web browser to the created app (e.g. http://<host>:<port>/) and you should see html page.

# RXQ in action

To use RXQ in your own application emulate how the example-site is structured. 

To start basically you need these files in your project.

* rxq-rewriter.xqy - simple rewriter and entry point for defining which modules you want to import
* lib/rxq.xqy - the RXQ library 

Then you will need setup a MarkLogic appserver (follow example site instructions), edit rxq-rewriter.xqy, importing the library modules containing your RESTXQ annotations.

All the following code examples are included in the example application.

The following xquery module illustrates how to annotate your modules functions using RESTXQ, which in turn will map them to a URL so they can be invoked via an HTTP Request. 

```
xquery version "1.0-ml";
module namespace addr="﻿http://example.org/address";
declare namespace rxq="﻿http://exquery.org/ns/restxq";

declare 
   %rxq:GET
   %rxq:path('/address/id/(.*)')
   %rxq:produces('text/html')
function addr:get-address($id){ 
   .... 
};
```

The `addr:get-address($id)` function has defined 3 RESTXQ annotations;

* _%rxq:GET_: indicates to select when HTTP REQUEST uses GET method
* _%rxq:path('/address/id/(.*)')_: maps the url /address/id/(.*) to this function, note the usage of regex matching group to capture `$id`
* _%rxq:produces('text/html')_: the output of this function, when returned by HTTP RESPONSE will have a content type of 'text/html'.

The `addr:get-address()` function is invoked when there is an HTTP GET Request on URL /address/id/(.*). 

The routing 'magic' is taken care of by [src/xquery/rxq-rewriter.xqy](https://github.com/xquery/rxq/blob/master/src/xquery/rxq-rewriter.xqy) (which you attach to MarkLogic appserver). The `%rxq:GET` annotation specifies the HTTP method and the `%rxq:path` annotation value specifies the concrete URL.

The value for the `addr:get-address` function's `$id` variable is taken from the first regex capture group in the url as specified by %rxq:path. This $id value can then be used by some search to lookup the address.

RXQ supports four RESTXQ annotations at this time;

* HTTP method annotation - `%rxq:GET` | `%rxq:PUT` | `%rxq:DELET`E | `%rxq:POST`
* Path annotation (maping url path) - `%rxq:path('/some/path/(.*)')`
* Produces annotation (output content-type) - `%rxq:produces('text/html')`
* Consumes annotation (ACCEPT) -

When you deploy these modules in a MarkLogic appserver you must then import those modules into the rxq-rewriter.xqy. for example if you wanted to use the addr:get-address() function, you would import the module in the rxq-rewriter.xqy 

```
(:~ STEP1 - import modules that contain annotation (controllers) here :)
import module namespace addr="﻿http://example.org/addr at "modules/addr.xqy";
```

This allows the RXQ implementation to scan for annotated functions and generate the neccessary url rewriting and evaluation.

Lastly, you can augment RESTXQ annotations with regular MarkLogic REST requests. The example below illustrates how to define a 'passthru' url, which will resources as a normal web server.

```
(: define non-restxq REST requests, example illustrates passthru mode :)
declare namespace rest = "http://marklogic.com/appservices/rest";
declare variable $default-requests as element(rest:request)* := (
    <request xmlns="http://marklogic.com/appservices/rest" uri="^/resources/(.*)$" endpoint="/rxq-rewriter.xqy?mode={$rxq:_PASSTHRU_MODE}" >
    <http method="GET" user-params="allow"/>
      <uri-param name="path">resources/$1</uri-param>
    </request>);
```    

Please review the [src/example-site/rxq-rewriter.xqy](https://github.com/xquery/rxq/blob/master/src/example-site/rxq-rewriter.xqy) to see how to setup your own. Note that the example-site also has a facility for profiling (enable $perf to fn:true).

To continue with our address example, lets add a function which inserts an address.

```
declare 
   %rxq:PUT
   %rxq:path('/address/id/(.*)')
   %rxq:produces('text/html')
   %rxq:consumes('application/xml')
function addr:insert-address($id){ 
   .... 
};
```
we are not interested in the actual implementation details of inserting the address (which could even be delegated to another xquery module, reinforcing the M in MVC). The `addr:insert-address` function would be invoked when an HTTP PUT Request is received.

Lastly, if we wanted to remove an address we need to support the HTTP DELETE method.

```
declare 
   %rxq:DELETE
   %rxq:path('/address/id/(.*)')
   %rxq:produces('text/html')
function addr:remove-address($id){ 
   .... 
};
```
This function could return some kind of success or failure text/html. 

It is the responsibility of your modules to return the correct HTTP status codes and the address library module provides some guidance of how to do this.

# Other functions

These helper functions can be useful to introspect the current RXQ enviroment.

_rxq:resource-functions()_ - returns all functions with RESTXQ annotations and their endpoint

_rxq:raw-params() as map:map_ - returns all in scope url params.

# Points of interest & Limitations

The RESTXQ spec is still in draft form; where things are currently unclear or in flux I made my own implementation decisions for the time being;

 * no `xdmp:eval` were hurt (or used) in the creation of RXQ ... all execution is done by first class function invokation available using XQuery 3.0
 * annotations are effectively mapping onto existing MarkLogic REST library functionality ( [rest functions](https://docs.marklogic.com/rest-lib))
 * RXQ is not pure XQuery 3.0 due to usage of xdmp: functions, such as [xdmp:annotation()](https://docs.marklogic.com/xdmp:annotation).
 * allow for full regex expressions within `%rxq:path`, instead of binding by variable names
 * its the responsibility of underlying function to grab hold of a PUT or POST content body
 * added some more metadata to the output of `rxq:resource-function()` 
 * 2 separate files e.g. at some point would like to merge rxq-rewriter.xqy into the rxq library module itself

The usage of RESTXQ annotations turns out to be a very concise way of building up flexible RESTFul interfaces, as well as providing the basis from which to create MVC architectures for our XQuery web applications.
